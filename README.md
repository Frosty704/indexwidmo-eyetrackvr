# indexwidmo-eyetrackvr
EyeTrackVR mounts for the WidmoVR prescription lens on the valve index

This is modeled after -

[Lerx-cnm's Widmo insert model](https://github.com/Lerx-cnm/WidmovrIndexInsert)

[Physics-Dudes v18 eyetracking mount](https://github.com/Physics-Dude/Phys-Index-EyetrackVR-HW/blob/main/ETVR%20ValveIndex%20Cam-LED%20Mount%20Rings/Index-EyetrackVRv4%20v18%20Print%20Me.stl)

this was made in blender with little to no 3d modeling/cad experience with guesstimated dimensions so excuse the poor topology
