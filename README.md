EyeTrackVR mounts for the WidmoVR prescription lens on the valve index

The clearance cut version has a small part of the top of the mount cut out inwards due to the very, very dodgy clearance at the top, however, both should still fit and not touch (it may touch the gasket)

This is modeled after -

[Lerx-cnm's Widmo insert model](https://github.com/Lerx-cnm/WidmovrIndexInsert)

[Physics-Dudes v18 eyetracking mount](https://github.com/Physics-Dude/Phys-Index-EyetrackVR-HW/blob/main/ETVR%20ValveIndex%20Cam-LED%20Mount%20Rings/Index-EyetrackVRv4%20v18%20Print%20Me.stl)

this was made in blender with little to no 3d modeling/cad experience with guesstimated dimensions so excuse the poor topology and or potential clearance/fitting issues
