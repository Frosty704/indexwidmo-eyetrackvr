[EyeTrackVR](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/) mounts for the [WidmoVR prescription lens on the valve index](https://widmovr.com/product/valve-index-prescription-lens-adapters/)

# ⚠️Print at your own risk, don't expect this to work perfectly. I jerry rigged this in blender with little to no CAD/3D modeling experience, Improvements may be made in the future
As of right now, the nose LED does poke my nose slightly. However a little electrical tape could be a bandaid fix

# V2 Mount

## Install the mount while your WidmoVR lens is not on the index. Take it off before installing  

1. You will have to line up the mount from the camera mount side so it is slightly under the Widmo's little lip at the lens. At this point the nose LED should be slightly peeking over and not fully down.

⚠️ **Avoid pushing down on the LED clips and camera clips as they can break easily**

2. Push that area down firmly (While still holding the rest of the mount in place) until you push it ever so slightly so it snaps into place.
   
3. Push down on the rest of the mount to make sure everything is down securely. 

4. After the mount is one with the WidmoVR lens, you can place it back onto the index lens as normal.
